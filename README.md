1. finish implementing pdfdocument testing
2. implement migration linter for migration testing*
3. setup user authentication system (e.g. with tokens)
4. setup black (or other) for unanimous code formatting
5. setup NGINX
6. (prepare staging environment)
7. prepare production settings
8. setup secure location for production envs (e.g. vault)
9. create CI pipeline running all tests, migration linter, black etc
10. extend document app admin for better CC access
11. Implement API documentation (e.g. openapi)
